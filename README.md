# Market Sales Simulation

This project simulates a simple market sales system using Python.
It focuses on object-oriented programming and basic data handling concepts.

## Features
- Reads product prices from a CSV file
- Creates sales receipts (Fis)
- Calculates total sales amounts
- Uses clean and modular OOP design

## Technologies
- Python
- CSV file handling
- Object-Oriented Programming

## Example
The system can simulate sales like:
- elma x2
- süt x1

And produces a receipt with total cost and timestamp.

## Learning Outcomes
- OOP design in Python
- Data structure usage (dict, list)
- Clean code and readability

**Note:** This project is for learning purposes and is open to further development.

## Square Number Calculator

This Python program calculates the square of numbers entered by the user.  
The user is prompted to input several numbers, and the program displays the square of each one.

### Features
- Takes numerical input from the user  
- Calculates the square of each number  
- Displays results in a clear format  

### Technologies Used
- Python 3

### Purpose
This project was created to practice basic Python concepts such as user input, variables, functions, and arithmetic operations.

### Possible Improvements
- Using loops instead of repetitive code  
- Input validation to prevent invalid entries  
- Allowing the user to choose how many numbers to calculate  

**Note:** This is a beginner-level project developed for learning and practice purposes.
