# Market Sales Simulation

This project simulates a simple market sales system using Python.
It focuses on object-oriented programming and basic data handling concepts.

## Features
- Reads product prices from a CSV file
- Creates sales receipts (Fis)
- Calculates total sales amounts
- Uses clean and modular OOP design

## Technologies
- Python
- CSV file handling
- Object-Oriented Programming

## Example
The system can simulate sales like:
- elma x2
- süt x1

And produces a receipt with total cost and timestamp.

## Learning Outcomes
- OOP design in Python
- Data structure usage (dict, list)
- Clean code and readability
