## Pool Tile Calculator (Python)

This project calculates the optimal square tile size and the total number of tiles required
to cover all surfaces of a rectangular swimming pool without cutting any tiles.

The solution uses mathematical logic based on the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) to ensure
that the selected tile size perfectly fits the pool dimensions.

### Project Overview
- Determines the largest possible square tile size using GCD
- Calculates the total surface area of the pool (floor, ceiling, and side walls)
- Computes the required number of tiles based on surface area

### Concepts Used
- Python functions and modular design
- Mathematical problem solving
- Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
- Clean and readable code structure
- Type hints for better code clarity

### Possible Improvements
- Supporting rectangular (non-square) tile sizes
- Adding unit selection (meters, centimeters)
- Creating a simple user interface
- Visualizing pool surfaces and tile placement

### Purpose
This project was developed to practice algorithmic thinking and apply mathematical concepts
to a real-world engineering problem.
